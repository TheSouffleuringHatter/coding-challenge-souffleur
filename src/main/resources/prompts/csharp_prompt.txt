# C#-Specific Requirements

Use modern C# 10+ features appropriately:
- Nullable reference types and null-conditional operators (?., ??)
- Pattern matching with switch expressions
- Records for immutable data carriers
- Init-only properties and required properties
- Local functions for helper methods
- LINQ for data querying and transformation
- async/await for asynchronous operations
- using statements for resource management
- Expression-bodied members for simple methods
- String interpolation ($"") over string concatenation
- Generic collections (List<T>, Dictionary<TKey, TValue>, HashSet<T>)
- Use appropriate data structures (Dictionary vs SortedDictionary, List vs LinkedList)
- Self-explanatory variable names (row vs i, channel vs ch); common abbreviations OK
- Follow C# naming conventions (PascalCase for public members, camelCase for local variables)
- Use var for local type inference when type is obvious
- Prefer readonly fields over mutable state
- Use System.Collections.Generic and System.Linq namespaces appropriately
