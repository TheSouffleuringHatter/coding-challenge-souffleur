SOLUTION_DESCRIPTION:
HASH SET validation with single-pass traversal

• Core idea: Track seen digits in each ROW, COLUMN, and 3x3 BOX using HASH SETS
• Steps:
  - Create arrays of hash sets for rows, columns, and boxes
  - Iterate through board once, checking each filled cell
  - For each digit, verify it's not already in corresponding row/column/box
  - Add valid digits to respective sets
• Why effective: O(1) lookup time for duplicate detection with single traversal
===SECTION_END===

EDGE_CASES:
• Empty cells ('.'): Skip validation, continue processing
• Single digit boards: Validate against basic rules
• Fully filled valid boards: All constraints satisfied
• Invalid placements: Early termination on first conflict

TIME_COMPLEXITY:
O(1) - Fixed 9x9 board size with constant operations

• Critical factor: Hash set operations are O(1) average case
• Worst case: Single traversal of 81 cells with constant work per cell

SPACE_COMPLEXITY:
O(1) - Fixed storage regardless of input

• Memory: 27 hash sets with maximum 9 elements each
• Optimization: Space usage bounded by Sudoku constraints

PROBLEM_STATEMENT:
36. Valid Sudoku

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:
• A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
• Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

Example 1:
Input: board =
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: board =
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
