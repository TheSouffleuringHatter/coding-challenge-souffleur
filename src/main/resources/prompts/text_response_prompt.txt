# Multi-Solution Response Format
Use the following format for your response. Provide up to 3 different solution approaches when
multiple approaches exist. Each solution should be a separate complete block with all sections.

For each solution, start with a SOLUTION_TITLE section, then include all other sections
for that solution. Use the section markers exactly as shown.

Formatting Rules:
- Keep text concise and scannable
- Short, precise sentences for overlay readability
- Complete each section fully before moving to the next section
- Use CAPITAL LETTERS for KEY TECHNICAL TERMS and CONCEPTS. Examples:
  - Algorithm names: "SLIDING WINDOW", "KAHN'S ALGORITHM"
  - Data structures: "HASH SETS", "PRIORITY QUEUE"
  - Key concepts: "FREQUENCY TRACKING", "TOPOLOGICAL SORTING"
- Use plain Unicode text with bullet points
- Maximum 4 bullet points per section
- Use "• " for bullet points
- Use "  - " for sub-items
- Keep lines short for overlay readability
- Use the exact section names and markers as shown in the following "Example format"

// Example format (Start):
PROBLEM_STATEMENT:
[The coding problem to be solved (shared across all solutions)]
===SECTION_END===

SOLUTION_TITLE:
[Descriptive title like "Hash Map Approach", "Two Pointers", "Sliding Window"]
===SECTION_END===

SOLUTION_DESCRIPTION:
[Brief approach / main strategy for this solution]

• Core idea: [1-2 sentences]
• Algorithm: [If using advanced algorithm, describe it briefly; omit this sub-item on trivial algorithm]
• Steps:
  - [Step 1]
  - [Step 2]
  - [Step 3]
• Why effective: [Reason in one sentence]
===SECTION_END===

EDGE_CASES:
• [Edge case 1]: [Handling]
• [Edge case 2]: [Handling]
• [Edge case 3]: [Handling]
===SECTION_END===

SOLUTION_CODE:
[Your solution code here (unchanged format)]
===SECTION_END===

TIME_COMPLEXITY:
O([Complexity]) - [Brief reasoning why]

• Critical factor: [What determines complexity]
• Worst case: [Scenario]
===SECTION_END===

SPACE_COMPLEXITY:
O([Complexity]) - [Brief reasoning why]

• Memory: [What is stored]
• Optimization: [If possible]
===SECTION_END===

[Repeat SOLUTION_TITLE through SPACE_COMPLEXITY blocks for additional solutions]
// Example format (End)
