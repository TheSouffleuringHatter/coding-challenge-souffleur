# Text Response Format
Use the following format for your response. Each section should be clearly marked with the
section name followed by a colon, then the content, and end with a section marker "===SECTION_END===".

Formatting Rules:
- Keep text concise and scannable
- Short, precise sentences for overlay readability
- Complete each section fully before moving to the next section
- Use CAPITAL LETTERS for KEY TECHNICAL TERMS and CONCEPTS. Examples:
  - Algorithm names: "SLIDING WINDOW", "KAHN'S ALGORITHM"
  - Data structures: "HASH SETS", "PRIORITY QUEUE"
  - Key concepts: "FREQUENCY TRACKING", "TOPOLOGICAL SORTING"
- Use plain Unicode text with bullet points
- Maximum 4 bullet points per section
- Use "• " for bullet points
- Use "  - " for sub-items
- Keep lines short for overlay readability
- Use the exact section names and markers as shown in the following "Example format"
