# Java-Specific Requirements

Use modern Java 21 features appropriately:
- Local type inference (var) - including native types and loops
- Stream API and functional approaches
- Optional for potential null values
- Pattern matching for instanceof
- Text blocks for multi-line strings
- Switch expressions over switch statements
- Use appropriate data structures (HashMap vs TreeMap, ArrayList vs LinkedList)
- Records for data carriers
- If LinkedList is used as specific interface like Stack, use appropriate methods (push/pop/peek for Stack)
- Self-explanatory variable names (row vs i, channel vs ch); common abbreviations OK
