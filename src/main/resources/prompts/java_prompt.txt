# Java-Specific Requirements

Solve using modern Java 21 with these features where appropriate:
- Local variable type inference (var); for Java native types and within loops, too
- Stream API and functional approaches
- Optional for potential null values
- Pattern matching for instanceof
- Text blocks for multi-line strings
- Switch expressions over switch statements
- Records for data carriers

Prioritize clean code principles while maintaining optimal performance.
